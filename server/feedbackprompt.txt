    "Feedback Analysis Instructions for Instructor’s Review of a Student’s Design Idea.\n\n
    STEP 1: Review previous ideas and chat logs to understand the context of the feedback.\n\n
    STEP 2: Decompose the feedback into individual sentences.\n\n
    STEP 3: Classify each sentence into one of three primary categories;
        'Question': This is a question feedback, which ensure that the feedback provider has a clear and accurate understanding of the design presented.;
        'Statement': This is ㅁ statement feedback, which provides relevant information or is directly related to a design idea to evaluate or suggest improvements.;
        'No feedback': This sentence is completely irrelevant to the feedback.\n\n
    STEP 4: Subcategorize each sentence based on its nature (There are 21 types of ‘Question’, three types of 'Statement' and no sub category for 'No feedback.'); 
        'Question':\n
            \"Low-Level\": Seeks factual details about the design.\n
                - Verification: Is X true?\n
                - Definition: What does X mean?\n
                - Example: What is an example of X?\n
                - Feature Specification: What (qualitative) attributes does X have?\n
                - Concept Completion: Who? What? When? Where?\n
                - Quantification: How much? How many?\n
                - Disjunctive: Is X or Y the case?\n
                - Comparison: How does X compare to Y?\n
                - Judgmental: What is your opinion on X?\n
            \"Deep Reasoning\": Explores deeper implications or reasons behind the design.\n
                - Interpretation: How is a particular event or pattern of information interpreted or summarized?\n
                - Goal Orientation: What are the motives behind an agent’s action?\n
                - Causal Antecedent: What caused X to occur?\n
                - Causal Consequent: What were the consequences of X occurring?\n
                - Expectational: Why is X not true?\n- Instrumental/Procedural: How does an agent accomplish a goal?\n
                - Enablement(DR): What object or resource enables an agent to perform an action?\n
            \"Generate Design\": Encourages innovative thinking about design challenges.\n
                - Proposal/Negotiation: Could a new concept be suggested/negotiated?\n
                - Scenario Creation: What would happen if X occurred?\n
                - Ideation: Generation of ideas without a deliberate end goal\n
                - Method: How could an agent accomplish a goal?\n
                - Enablement(GD): What object or resource could enable an agent to perform an action?\n
        'Statement':\n
            \"Information\": Share related information or examples.\n
            \"Evaluation\": Assess the student’s design idea. Stating general facts rather than evaluating a student's ideas doesn't belong.\n
            \"Recommendation\": Provide actionable suggestions for improvement.\n\n
    STEP 5: Summarize the extracted knowledge from each category. Knowledge includes only key approaches and keywords and excludes complex context.;\n
        'Question':\n
            \"Low-Level\": DO NOT ADD knowledge.\n
            \"Deep Reasoning\": Suggest design considerations.\n
            \"Generate Design\": Suggest new design opportunities.\n
        'Statement':\n
            \"Information\": Details the provided information.\n
            \"Evaluation\": Describes the assessment of the design.\n
            \"Recommendation\": Outline ideas for enhancement.\n
        'No feedback': DO NOT ADD knowledge.\n
    STEP 6: Evaluate the feedback on a scale of 1 to 5 based on the following criteria. There are three different criteria depending on whether the feedback is a 'Question' or a 'Statement'.\n
        'Question':\n
            \"Uniquness\": The question is unique.\n
            \"Relevance\": The question is relevant to the context of the current discussion.\n
            \"High-level\": The question is high-level.(If the question falls into the \"Low-Level\" category, it's between 1 and 2. Otherwise, it's between 3 and 5.)\n
        'Statement':\n
            \"Specificity\": The feedback is specific.\n
            \"Justification\": The feedback is justified.\n
            \"Active\": The feedback is actionable\n
        'No feedback': DO NOT RATE.\n
    Response Only in JSON array, which looks like, {\"sentences\":[{\"sentence\": \"\", \"categories\":\"\", \"type\":\"\", \"knowledge\":\"\", \"evaluation\":{\"uniquness\": 0-5, \"relevance\": 0-5, \"high-level\": 0-5, \"specificity\": 0-5, \"justification\": 0-5, \"active\": 0-5}}]}.\n
        \"sentence\": Individual unit of feedback.\n
        \"categories\": Category of feedback. ('Question' or 'Statement' or 'No feedback')\n
        \"type\": Subcategory of feedback (e.g., \"Low-Level\" or \"Deep Reasoning\" or \"Generate Design\" or \"Information\" or \"Evaluation\" or \"Recommendation\").\n
        \"knowledge\": A key one-sentence summary of the knowledge from the feedback described in STEP5 that is brief and avoids proper nouns.\n
        \"evaluation\": JSON with the evaluation score based on the criteria. The criteria that should be evaluated in STEP 6 have a value between 1-5, with the rest evaluated as 0.\n\n
